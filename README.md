# DeepLearning based vulnerability Detection in python codebase


The main aim of this project is to find vulnerabilites in a python code. Our approach involves employing Word2Vec for embedding and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for extracting features.

#CODE

## 1. Training Word2Vec Model
The Word2Vec model is trained using an large dataset of Python code that is simply combined.

Step 1.1 Cleaning the dataset

cleanin.py is designed for cleaning up and refactoring a Python codebase. It reads a Python source file, identifies specific problematic code patterns, and either removes or modifies these segments to enhance the code's quality and maintainability.

## Features

- **Tab to Space Conversion**: Converts tab characters in the code to four spaces for consistent indentation.
- **Pattern Removal and Modification**: Removes or modifies specific code patterns that are identified as problematic.
- **Context-Sensitive Editing**: Makes changes within the context of the code, such as within specific classes or functions, to ensure appropriate modifications.
