# DeepLearning based vulnerability Detection in python codebase


The main aim of this project is to find vulnerabilites in a python code. Our approach involves employing Word2Vec for embedding and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for extracting features.

## Training Word2Vec Model
The Word2Vec model is trained using an large dataset of Python code that is simply combined.

###Cleaning the dataset
