# Deep Learning-based Vulnerability Detection in Python Codebase

The main aim of this project is to find vulnerabilities in a Python codebase. Our approach involves employing Word2Vec for embedding and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for extracting features.

## CODE

### 1. Training Word2Vec Model
The Word2Vec model is trained using a large dataset of Python code that is simply combined.

#### Step 1.1 Cleaning the Dataset

[Python Code Dataset from Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/3559480#.XeTMzdVG2Hs)

`cleaning.py` is designed for cleaning up and refactoring a Python codebase. It reads a `pythontraining.txt` file, identifies specific problematic code patterns, and either removes or modifies these segments to enhance the code's quality and maintainability.

#### Features

- **Tab to Space Conversion**: Converts tab characters in the code to four spaces for consistent indentation.
- **Pattern Removal and Modification**: Removes or modifies specific code patterns that are identified as problematic.
- **Context-Sensitive Editing**: Makes changes within the context of the code, such as within specific classes or functions, to ensure appropriate modifications.
